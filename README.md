# 1. play pT games
- 1st order simple dense: simple_dense.py created-
  - visualization of first layer weight included
- 2nd order less simple dense, version 0.2
  - data-pipelines (torch.utils.data.DataLoader) included
- 2n order first cnn
# 2. integrate
- produce and open data with L-system
# 3. Pre-process: 
#  a ) set it up for one systems without depedencies
#  b ) sort (not for sandboxes)
# 4. get dependencies
# A. TODOs

- RNN / LSTMS --> should be tested at the L-system
