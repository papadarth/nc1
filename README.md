# 1. play pT games
- 1st order simple dense: simple_dense.py created-
  - visualization of first layer weight included
- 2nd order less simple dense, version 0.2
  - data-pipelines (torch.utils.data.DataLoader) included
- 2n order first cnn
  - my first cnn (LeNet) running
# 2. integrate
- produce and open data with L-system
  - two starting systems are generated
# 3 learn RNN / LSTM time series prediction
- i) re-use sin predictor (LSTM) for L-system
- TODOs
  - encoder / decoder games
  - how to implement gates on my own
    - learn from GoogLeNet?
    - learn from pytorch recurive net topologies
# 4. Pre-process: 
#  a ) set it up for one systems without depedencies
#  b ) sort (not for sandboxes)
# 5. get dependencies
# A. TODOs
  - CNNs
    - implement AlexNet
    - implement GoogleNet
